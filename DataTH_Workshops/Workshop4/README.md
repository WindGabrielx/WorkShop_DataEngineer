# Workshop4
Welcome to my workshop! In this session, I will share various case studies and practical examples from my learning journey through DataTH, an online platform offering the "Road to Data Engineer" course. The content here showcases the skills and knowledge Iâ€™ve gained. This workshop covers the following topics:

  - Understanding the tools used for creating Data Pipelines
  - Introduction to the concept of Apache Airflow
  - DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph
  - Familiarizing with Cloud Composer
  - Building a data pipeline with Apache Airflow
  - Using the Taskflow API

    workshop4_1:
      - Create a simple pipeline using task dependencies: T1 >> T2, where T1 prints "HELLO WORLD" and T2 prints the current date and time.
        After finishing the coding, copy the file from Cloud Shell to the DAGs bucket.
        Once you click on Airflow, it will display the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph) for the pipeline.
