# Workshop_DataTH_Workshop6

Welcome to my workshop! In this session, I will share various case studies and practical examples from my learning journey on DataTH, an online platform offering the "Road to Data Engineer" course. This workshop showcases the skills and knowledge I've gained and covers the following topics:

- Connecting a Looker Dashboard with Google BigQuery to view the results of all completed workshop exercises more clearly. (However, my Google Cloud free trial has expired, so Iâ€™m currently using an Excel file that I upload     directly to Looker. As a result, the totals may not match the original. This alternative allows you to try and view the data using this method.)
