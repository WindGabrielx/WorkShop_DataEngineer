# Workshop_DataTH_Workshop6

Welcome to my workshop! In this session, I will share various case studies and practical examples from my learning journey on DataTH, an online platform offering the "Road to Data Engineer" course. This workshop showcases the skills and knowledge I've gained and covers the following topics:

- Using the View function on Google Cloud BigQuery
- Connecting a Looker Dashboard with Google BigQuery to view the results of all completed workshop exercises more clearly. (However, my Google Cloud free trial has expired, so I’m currently using an Excel file that I upload directly to Looker. As a result, the totals may not match the original. This alternative allows you to try and view the data using this method.)

**I also downloaded the original Looker Dashboard, which was connected to Google BigQuery, as a PDF file. You can view it under the file name "Workshop6.pdf." Additionally, I’ve provided an updated version that I adjusted, allowing you to explore and interact with it.**
