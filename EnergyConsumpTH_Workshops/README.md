Welcome to my workshop! In this session, I will share my workshop on the energy consumption of Thailand, using data that I downloaded as a .csv file from the publicly available resources of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA). This workshop covers the following topics:

- Set Environment Variable and PySpark Setup
- Data Cleansing and Data Profiling with Spark
  - Coverage Anomalies: Checking and replacing missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualization with Seaborn
- Saving Data to .CSV
