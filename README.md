# Workshops_DataEngineer
Welcome to my repository! This collection contains various workshops and practice projects I have completed to enhance my skills in the data engineering role. Each project allows me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, helping me better understand the data engineering landscape.

In this repository, you will find workshops focused on key areas such as databases, data warehouses, data lakes, ETL processes, and data analysis and visualization techniques. Additionally, Iâ€™ve included projects involving Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Apache Airflow for pipeline orchestration, Databricks for data processing, etc. These projects showcase my journey of learning and my readiness for professional opportunities in the field.
